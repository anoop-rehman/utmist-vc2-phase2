X get ant training to match a fixed target velocity.
X- add target vel to the obs vector.
X- add averaging over time.
X- change reward to be 1/dist thing instead. 
X-- with removal of outliers - iqr range.
- add space for 2 more observations (for spin and kick)!!
- see if we can continue training from a saved model
- see if we can train on cloud compute for future tests
-- see if / how to gpu accelerate
- see how to integrate this model in the soccer env. 
- get ant training to match a varying target velocity.
- get ant training to match a varying target acceleration.
